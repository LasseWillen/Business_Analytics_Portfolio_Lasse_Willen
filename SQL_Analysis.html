<h1>Heart Attack Diagnosis Analysis</h1>

<p>Since health is a topic of major interest to me, I conducted a diagnosis of medical datasets with my fellow students Leon Kozak and Vincent Stilz. The dataset can be found on Kaggle using the provided link: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sukhmandeepsinghbrar/heart-attack-dataset">Heart Attack Dataset</a>.</p>

<p>This dataset provides a collection of clinical metrics and diagnostic outcomes aimed at understanding cardiovascular health. It includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Age and Gender (coded as integers), fundamental demographics for risk assessment.</li>
    <li>Heart Rate, Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure (integers), key cardiovascular health indicators.</li>
    <li>Blood Sugar levels (float), critical for diabetes management, a risk factor for heart conditions.</li>
    <li>CK-MB and Troponin levels (floats), biochemical markers that indicate heart muscle damage and are crucial for diagnosing myocardial injuries.</li>
    <li>Result: A diagnosis outcome, "positive" or "negative," reflecting the presence or absence of a cardiovascular condition.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using SQL, we took various steps to analyze the data set and came to these findings:</p>
<p><span class="bold">Dataset Verification:</span> The initial query confirmed the successful upload of the medical dataset.</p>

    <p><span class="bold">Diagnosis Counts:</span> The dataset contains 810 positive and 509 negative diagnoses for heart attacks.</p>

    <p><span class="bold">Average Health Metrics by Diagnosis:</span></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Patients with a negative diagnosis have lower average CK-MB and troponin levels (2.55 and 0.027 respectively) compared to those with a positive diagnosis, where the averages are significantly higher (23.27 and 0.571 respectively). This suggests that elevated levels of these markers are associated with positive heart attack diagnoses.</li>
        <li>Other health metrics like age, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and blood sugar levels also vary between the two groups, with positive diagnoses showing slightly higher average age and heart rate but similar blood pressure readings and lower blood sugar levels.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><span class="bold">Age Distribution:</span> The overall patient population shows a broader age range with an average age slightly lower than that of positive diagnoses, highlighting age as a risk factor.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Gender Distribution:</span> Males have a higher count of both positive and negative diagnoses compared to females, indicating a potential gender-related risk factor in heart attack incidence.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Blood Sugar Analysis:</span> Among patients with a positive heart attack diagnosis, blood sugar levels ranged widely, suggesting variability in glucose management among those diagnosed with heart conditions.</p>
    <p><span class="bold">Marker Levels:</span> Troponin and CK-MB levels were substantially higher on average in positive heart attack diagnoses, underscoring their importance as biomarkers in heart attack detection.</p>
    
<div class="code-container">
<pre><code>-- Analysis of heart attack diagnoses based on troponin threshold
SELECT troponin > 0.1 AS troponin_high_risk, result, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM medical_data
GROUP BY troponin_high_risk, result;

-- Analysis of heart attack diagnoses based on CK-MB threshold
SELECT ck_mb > 5 AS ck_mb_high_risk, result, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM medical_data
GROUP BY ck_mb_high_risk, result;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Applying thresholds for troponin (>0.1) and CK-MB (>5) revealed a significant association with positive heart attack diagnoses, indicating these thresholds could be effective in risk stratification.</p>
<p>In summary, the SQL analysis highlights the importance of CK-MB and troponin levels in diagnosing heart attacks, alongside other factors like age, gender, and blood sugar levels. Elevated markers, older age, and being male are associated with a higher risk of positive diagnoses. This data-driven approach provides insights into the demographics and health metrics correlating with heart attack occurrences, offering valuable information for medical research and patient care.</p>
